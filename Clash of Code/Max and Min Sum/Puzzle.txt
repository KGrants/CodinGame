Given n integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly n-1 of the n integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

example

n = 5

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

You will need the sum of 4 items.

The minimum sum is 1+2+3+4=10 and the maximum sum is 2+3+4+5=14.

The function will print 10 14
