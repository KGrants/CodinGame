You desperately need to go to the toilet. There are several options - some close, others far, some occupied, some not. Find a toilet on time, or soil your pants!
- You have maxtime seconds and some speed (m/s) to reach toilets.
- Each toilet has an id, a distance (m) and an occupationtime (s) (time being occupied)

Output the id of the toilet that you can reach and is available in the least number of seconds, or output Ohh sh*t if there is no available toilet within reach in maxtime seconds. There is always one or no best toilet.

Example
maxtime 20 seconds,
speed    5 m/s, 
toilet 0, distance  50 meter, occupationtime 25 seconds
toilet 1, distance 100 meter, occupationtime  5 seconds

--> 0 reached in 10 seconds, but only available after 25 seconds (occupationtime)
--> 1 reached in 20 seconds, and directly available (occupationtime was 5 seconds, which passed during travelling)
Output: 1
And, all of this with maxtime 10 seconds would lead to Ohh sh*t!.

Input
Line 1: 2 space-separated integers: the maxtime in seconds before you cannot hold it anymore, and your speed in meters per second.
Line 2: one integer: the number of toilets ntoilet.
Next ntoilet lines: per toilet three space separated integers : the id, the distance in meters and the occupationtime in seconds.

Output
The id of the toilet that you can use after the least number of seconds, or the string Ohh sh*t! if that least number of seconds is bigger than maxtime.
Constraints
0<maxtime, speed, ntoilet, distance, occupationtime <= 500

Example
Input
30 5
2
0 50 25
1 100 5
Output
