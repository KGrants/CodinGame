A government has a progressive tax system.

- First $5,000 of income ($1 - $5,000) - taxed at 0% (no tax)
- Next $5,000 of income ($5,001 - $10,000) - taxed at 5%
- Next $10,000 of income ($10,001 - $20,000) - taxed at 10%
- Next $20,000 of income ($20,001 - $40,000) - taxed at 20%
- Afterwards ($40,001 onwards) - taxed at 30%

If you are taxed $X, how much was your income? Assuming that your income is an integer dollar value. If there are multiple possible answers, give the lowest possible amount.

More specifically, find the minimum integer dollar value of income N such that incomeTax(N) = X. For example, if you are taxed $1.25, then your income is $5,025.
