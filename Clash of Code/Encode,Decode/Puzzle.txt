Encode or decode a message composed only of letters write in uppercase: a string m, with a key: an integer k.
By encoding we shift each character by k letters in the alphabet. After Z we come back to A.
By decoding, it is the same thing but in the other direction. Before A, it is Z.
An integer d give the direction: 1 for encoding, -1 for decoding.

Input
Line 1: a string m for the message to encode or decode
Line 2: an integer d for direction: 1 for encoding, -1 for decoding
Line 3: an integer k for the key
