Give the sum of the numbers from 1 to n, after sorting the digits in each number by ascending order.

The sorting of the digits in ascending order happens like this:
1 -> 1
23 -> 23
52 -> 25
10 -> 01 -> 1

Then, compute the sum from 1 to n. For n = 25, it gives:
sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + .. + 9 + 01 + 11 + 12 + ... + 19 + 02 + 12 + 22 + 23 + 24 + 25
Note that 10 became 01, 20 became 02 and 21 became 12. The rest of the numbers stayed the same (because their digits were already in ascending order).

Input
Line 1 : An integer n that is the upper limit of numbers to consider for the sum. The numbers up until n included will be considered.

Output
Line 1 : The sum of all the numbers from 1 to n after sorting their digits in ascending order.

Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 100000

Example
Input
10
Output
46
