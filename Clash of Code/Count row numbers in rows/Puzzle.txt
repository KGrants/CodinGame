Count all the numbers equal to their line number.
The first line number is 0.

Example 1 :
If input is
1
0 1 2 3 4

Output is 1 because only one 0 is on line 0

Example 2 :
If input is
2
0 1 2 3 4
1 1 2 3 4
Output is 3 because only one 0 is on line 0 and there are two 1s in line 1 so 1 + 2 = 3

Input
First line : N number of lines to read
N Next lines : List of K integers

Output
Number of numbers on the correct line.
