A program that calculates the total area of a set of geometric shapes, whose type and dimensions are provided. The geometric shapes can be circles or rectangles. The program should return the total area of all the geometric shapes.

Input
Line 1: An integer N representing the number of geometric shapes to calculate.
Next N lines: A character ( C or R), representing the type of geometric shape (C for circle, R for rectangle) followed by two integers a and b, representing the dimensions of the geometric shape (the radius for a circle or the length and width for a rectangle). If it is a circle, b can be ignored.

Output
A single line containing the total area of all the geometric shapes. The total must be rounded to 2 decimal places

Example
Input
4
R 3 4
C 2 0
R 5 6
C 3 0
Output
82.84
