You must create a script which can filter logs based on their log level:
FATAL is level 0
ERROR is level 1
WARNING is level 2
INFO is level 3
DEBUG is level 4

FATAL is more important than ERROR, ERROR more than WARNING, etc.

The log line is format is <Service> LEVEL: message
Nothing contained inside the message is considered a log level.
