The teacher is on his first day with a new class of 10 students, in a room with 10 seats. (For clarity, we don't need to bother where the seats are positioned.)

He plans to assign a seat for every student, knowing that a student sitting closer to the teacher will get a better education, and one sitting further away will get a worse education.

He can only read their scores from the Computer Science tests of the past 3 years.

His task is to assign to the worst students the seat closest to the teacher, and to continue until all the seats are filled.

If two students have the same average score, the first student provided in the input gets the closer seat.

Input
10 lines: A space separated string row containing:

Output
10 lines: The name of the student at n-th position starting from the closest to teacher.

Constraints
Every name is a string containing no spaces.
0.0 ≤ score for year 1, 2, 3 ≤ 9.9
