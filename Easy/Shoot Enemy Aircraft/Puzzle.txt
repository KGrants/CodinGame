There are enemy aircraft (> or <) in the sky (made of .). Each turn they move one cell forward. You are in charge of shooting them with a surface-to-air missile (^). You can only shoot vertically. Each turn your missiles move one cell up.

Note: When you shoot, the missile appears at the same altitude as the launcher. Each turn, the missile moves one cell up.

You have to print, each turn, if you WAIT or if you SHOOT. You have to shoot all the enemy aircraft, and your stock is just enough, so don't SHOOT if you can't hit an aircraft. After shooting every missile, do not print the last WAITs.
