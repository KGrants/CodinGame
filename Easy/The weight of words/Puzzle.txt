You have to decrypt a h x w grid of encrypted text.

Each row/column of the grid has its own weight, which is the sum of the binary representation of its letters in ASCII (A=65, B=66, ...., Z=90).
For example the row ABCD has a weight of 266 (65 + 66 + 67 + 68).
The grid only contains uppercase letters from A to Z

To decrypt the grid you'll have to:
First, for each of the w columns move the letters down a row weight of the column times
And then, for each of the h rows move the letters to the column at their right weight of the row times

The rows/columns form a cycle, if a letter should leave the grid from one side, make it appear at the other side
