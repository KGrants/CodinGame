Given an ASCII art representation of 7-segment display you need to convert it to a number.

Note: number should be converted as is, including leading zeroes.
Input
3 lines: 7-segment display image consisting only of vertical lines, underscores and spaces.
Length of every line is divisible by 3 (so trailing spaces are preserved).
