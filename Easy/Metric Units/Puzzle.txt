The goal of this exercise is to add two lengths with given metric units.
To calculate it properly you first need to convert them to the same unit.
Present the result using the smaller unit.

For instance:
4cm + 2dm
must convert 2dm to 20cm:
4cm + 20cm
it then results to:
24cm

If you like to challenge yourself a little more...
Try to limit the number of ifs and switches as much as possible in your code.
